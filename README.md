# Automatic-Solar-Tracking-System
Solar tracking allows more energy to be produced because the solar array is able to remain aligned to the sun.an automatic tracking system which will keep the solar panels aligned with the sun in order to maximize efficiency. In this project we are trying to increase the solar power production and safety of the solar power system. This project has two different parts those are solar tracker and PWM charge controller. We have tried to make a tracker which can track more sun intensity for the solar panel.Using the solar tracker system we can produce more energy than the analog solar system.
